                Sentiment Analysis in Natural Language Processing
                Tamil-English codemixed sentiment analysis emerges as a crucial area of
research and application, particularly in digital platforms where users freely express
themselves in a mixture of languages. By developing robust methods to analyze sentiments
in codemixed text, we can gain deeper insights into user perceptions, preferences, and
attitudes in diverse linguistic contexts. 
                Facebook AI Research (FAIR) offers an open-source, free package called
FastText for word classification and embedding learning. With this approach, one can create
algorithms for supervised or unsupervised learning to get vector representations of words. It
assesses these models as well. Both the CBOW and Skip-gram models are supported by
FastText.
